The Problem We Set Out to Solve
Pharma companies spend a lot of money on marketing initiatives, yet it's still difficult to effectively engage doctors. Doctors need information that is not just educational but also captivating and aesthetically pleasing because of their hectic schedules and the numerous businesses fighting for their attention.
Despite routinely interacting with doctors, the majority of pharmaceutical field managers (Zonal Business Managers, Regional Business Managers, etc.) lack the resources necessary to produce expert, campaign-specific information while on the fly.  Rather, they frequently depend on uninteresting static visuals or formulaic presentations.
The demand was obvious: pharmaceutical professionals needed a straightforward yet effective platform that would enable them to swiftly produce branded image and video material that was customized for particular campaigns and products without the need for sophisticated technological know-how.
